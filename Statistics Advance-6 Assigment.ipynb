    "* Example: In a social science study comparing the effectiveness of different intervention programs across schools, if ANOVA   indicates significant differences, Scheffé's method can be used to conduct all pairwise comparisons while controlling for   Type I error rate.\n",

    "# EXAMPLE SCENARIO :\n",
    "\n",
    "* Let's say a researcher conducts an experiment to determine whether different types of exercise (aerobic, strength           training, and flexibility) have different effects on cardiovascular fitness (measured by VO2 max). The researcher collects   data from three groups of participants who undergo each type of exercise program for 12 weeks. After conducting an ANOVA     on the VO2 max scores post-intervention, the researcher finds a significant overall effect (p < 0.05).\n",
    "\n",
    "* At this point, a post-hoc test is necessary to determine which specific exercise types lead to significantly different VO2   max scores. Here, the researcher might choose Tukey's HSD test if the assumptions of equal variances and equal sample       sizes are met. If the assumptions are not met, another appropriate post-hoc test such as Bonferroni correction, Sidak       correction, Duncan's test, or Scheffé's method would be selected based on the specific characteristics of the data (e.g.,   sample sizes, variance homogeneity).\n",
